## June 10, 2015 4-5 pm EST - NIST Microstructure project meeting

**Current Tasks**

* Josh: Respond to reviewers for manuscript

* Josh, David, AJ, Zhen: Identify new directions
    * MKS for electronic structure
        * [View Slides](../img/MKS_electronic_structure.pdf)
        * [A basic "derivation" of DFT from my thesis](../img/DFT_basics.pdf). The thesis is still a draft, so if you see any typos or have suggestions let me know.
        * [More information on the math of DFT (especially lecture 5)](http://www.physics.metu.edu.tr/~hande/teaching/741.html)
        * "Green's functions" are often used in many-body quantum mechanics.  This is not my expertise, but I would like to learn more. Some info (that I haven't thoroughly read yet):
            * [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_function_%28many-body_theory%29)
            * [Barbieri Notes](http://ribf.riken.jp/~barbieri/mbgf_files/mbgf_notes.pdf)
    * MKS linkages for linking initial/final atomic structures (protein folding?)

* AJ, Fred, Zhen: Learn n-point statistics, MKS
    * Download, install, and test new pyMKS version
    * Read existing manuscripts

* Fred: Look into Slack account, possibility of integrating with MatIN

**Other Notes**

* For those trying to learn python, these resources might be helpful:
    * [Dive Into Python](http://www.diveintopython.net/)
    * [Software Carpentry](software-carpentry.org/v4/python/)
